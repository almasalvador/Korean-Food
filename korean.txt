This is a library of Korean recipes from my life experience as a Korean home cook: eating, living, cooking, experimenting, fermenting, foraging, learning from my family, friends, people around me, Korean street vendors, restaurants, market stalls, Buddhist monks, and whoever I met who made delicious food that I wanted to learn. : )
